[**Project Report**](https://github.com/MoronSlayer/Music-Recommendation-System/blob/main/628_final_proj_Prashant_Ritesh.pdf)

Methods used to build the Recommendation System:
-Matrix Factorization <br />
-Logistic Regression <br />
-Decision trees <br />
-Random Forest <br />
-Gradient boosting <br />
-Ensemble: Bagging and Boosting --  to combine results of all previous methods  <br />

Improvements to be implemented: <br />
-using neighborhood methods  <br />
-using deep learning <br />
-combining more results to create a more accurate Ensemble method  <br />
